# E-commerce simulation in console

## Applied Skills
* Java
* CRUD

## Objective
Create a menu with all basic CRUD operations in console for an e-commerce.

## Summary
I decided to create a store called "Hardware Computer Parts" and besides applying CRUD operations for products, I implemented the possibility of creating users with different permissions. These permissions include those of a regular buyer, which consist of listing, searching, and purchasing products, and those of an administrator, who in addition to the operations a buyer has, can also register products and users.
